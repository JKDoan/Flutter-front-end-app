Front-end Flutter app that I worked on with others for a group project.

My contribution to the project was building the screens and functionalities for the tutorial on how to place a widget to the homescreen  for the older demographic of the app. The content of the tutorial is shown depending on whether the user is on iOS or Android:

- The iOS version shows several screens on how to place a widget to the homescreen
- The Android version shows a native prompt to place a widget to the homescreen without any other screens.

Downloadable APK is in the ```apk``` folder
